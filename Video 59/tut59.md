## File Handling in C++

File handling means reading from and writing to files (like .txt, .csv, etc.) using classes provided by the C++ standard library.

- Programs run in RAM, meaning data exists only while the program is running, when a program ends, all data in RAM is lost automatically.
- File handling allows storing data in secondary memory (like HDD or SSD), so it can be preserved permanently and can be saved and accessed even after the program terminates.
- For file operations, C++ provides file stream classes in the <fstream> header such as ofstream, ifstream, fstream.
