# Inheritance In C++ Overview

- Reusablity is a very important feature of OOPs.
- In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it.
- Reusing classes saves time and money.
- Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again.

## What is Inheritance in C++

- The concept of Reusability in C++ is supported using Inheritance.
- We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting from it.
- The existing class is called as the Base Class.
- The new class which is inherited is called as the Derived Class.
- Reusing classes saves time and money.
- There are different types of inheritance in C++.

## Forms of Inheritance in C++

- Single Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance
- Hierarchical Inheritance
- Multilevel Inheritance
- Hybrid Inheritance

### Single Inheritance

- A Derived class with only one Base class

### Multiple Inheritance

- A Derived class with more than one Base class.

### Hierarchical Inheritance

- Several Derived classes from single Base class.

### Multilevel Inheritance

- Deriving a class from already derived class.

### Hybrid Inheritance

- Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.
- A class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance.
- However, one of the parent classes is not a base class.
