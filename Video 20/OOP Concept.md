Why OOPS?
1. C++ language was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented features to C language.
2. As the size of the program increases, readability, maintainability and bug-free nature of program decreases.
3. This was the major problem with languages like C which relied upon functions or procedures(hence th name procedural programming language)
4. As a result, the possibility of not addressing the problem in an effective manner was high.
5. Also, as data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromised.
6. Using classes solves this problem by modelling program as a real world scenario.

PROCEDURE ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
1. Consists of writing a set of instruction for computer to follow
2. Main focus is on function and not on flow of data
3. Funtions can either use local or global data
4. Data moves openly from funtion to funtion

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
1. Works on the co concept of classes and objects.
2. A class is a template to create objects.
3. Treats data as a critical element.
4. Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and funtions around the objects.

BASIC CONCEPTS IN OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
1. Classes - Basic template for creating objects.
2. Objects - Basic run time entities.
3. Data Abstraction & Encapsulation - Wrapping data and funcitons into single unit.
4. Inheritance - Properties of one class can be inherited into others.
5. Polymorphism - ability to take more then one forms.
6. Dynamic Binding - code which will execute is not known until the program runs
7. Message Passing - Object.message(Information) call format.

BENEFITS OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
1. Better code reusability using objects and Inheritance.
2. Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems.
3. Multiple objects can co-exist without any interference.
4. Software Complexity can be easily managed.
